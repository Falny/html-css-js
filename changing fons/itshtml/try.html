And this feeling had been more painfully perceived by young
d'Artagnan—for so was the Don Quixote of this second Rosinante
named—from his not being able to conceal from himself the ridiculous
appearance that such a steed gave him, good horseman as he was. He
had sighed deeply, therefore, when accepting the gift of the pony from
M. d'Artagnan the elder. He was not ignorant that such a beast was
worth at least twenty livres; and the words which had accompanied the
present were above all price.
"My son," said the old Gascon gentleman, in that pure Bearn PATOIS
of which Henry IV could never rid himself, "this horse was born in the
house of your father about thirteen years ago, and has remained in it
ever since, which ought to make you love it. Never sell it; allow it to die
tranquilly and honorably of old age, and if you make a campaign with it,
take as much care of it as you would of an old servant. At court,
provided you have ever the honor to go there," continued M. d'Artagnan
the elder, "—an honor to which, remember, your ancient nobility gives
you the right—sustain worthily your name of gentleman, which has been
worthily borne by your ancestors for five hundred years, both for your
own sake and the sake of those who belong to you.
